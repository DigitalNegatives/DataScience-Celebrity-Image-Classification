# DataScience-Celebrity_Image_Classification

This is a celebrity image classification model using TensorFlow and later Keras. 
This was worked on a with a team of four who wanted to learn deep learning. 
Although we did not participate in the challenge the data used is from 
Microsoft's 1 million celebrity recognition challenge 
(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ms-celeb-1m-challenge-recognizing-one-million-celebrities-real-world/).

The model and implementation has gone through a number of iterations. 
Included in this repository will be four of the main iterations.
The code in this repository is a cleaned-up version of the original development.
